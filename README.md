# funny-video-transmission

Converts png sequences to a wav file which can be broadcast in call and decoded back into a video. No practical reason to do so, just for fun.

Currently only supports 32x32 pngs. Color is converted to grayscale. Receiver is very fuzzy and video is very unstable/jittery.
